# FormikForm

## Description:
This project was an assignment for the MIT XPRO course. We were given some files and code to work with and were instructed to create form using Formik . The form must have an email as username and both fields cannot be empty. It is a basic sign in with username and password. 

## How to Run:  
Go to the README.MD page to implement React
- or - view it on codesandbox here: [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/jengerred/FormikForm) 
- or - to see it live click here: [netlify](https://jensformikform.netlify.app/)

## Roadmap of future improvements:: 
I would like to use this form if I needed a sign up and I would like to be able to save the input of the data for users to actually log in.
